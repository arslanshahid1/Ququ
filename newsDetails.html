                        <p>MMA – "I want to make my professional MMA debut at the end of 2022, and at 28 I want to be world champion of my weight class in the organization where I signed a professional contract." This is what 25-year-old Shaquille van Zichem
                            says in a discussion with Times of Suriname, after his amateur MMA debut Saturday in Combat Night, one of the great amateur MMA organizations is in Florida.</p>
                        <p>Van Zichem is very happy with the first victory and indicates that he is not ready for this year. "This year I will definitely come again</p>
                        <p>In action and if all goes well, I will also fight my third party this year. I don't know when my second fight will take place, but I don't want to reveal that just yet. I've set very high goals for my MMA career, because this isn't
                            a hobby or a part-time job. I'm a full-time athlete and I put everything on it. I will work hard to become multiple champion in the largest MMA organizations in the world. One of my goals is to get a contract from the UFC,
                            because the UFC is the biggest MMA.</p>
                        <p>organization of the world." Van Zichem knows it will be very difficult to sign a contract with UFC right away, so he will first go for the world championship in Combat Night, so he plays in the viewers at other organizations, such
                            as Bellator MMA and ONE Fighting Championship. After this, he will prey on a professional contract with UFC. Van Zichem won the fight on Saturday on points. "I'm going to have a good first round and I think I was the best in
                            this round, but in the second round I did the best," he said. stand back a bit. In the third round I was also the better one and it would have been a hair or I had got him in a sub-mission, but time was just over. I don't know
                            which country the opponent is from and what his name is. The original fighter had withdrawn a few days before the fight. There were three potential opponents on schedule for me, but I didn't know who I was going to play against.
                            I had to go out - finally come out against a fighter who comes out in a higher division. I didn't hesitate and I agreed to the fight."</p>
